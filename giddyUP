To keep things running smoothly in the future:

Always pull changes before starting work:
Copygit pull origin main

Create a new branch for new features or changes:
Copygit checkout -b new-feature-branch

After making changes, commit them:
Copygit add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

Push the branch and create a pull request on GitHub:
Copygit push origin new-feature-branch

After the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it on GitHub.
Then, update your local main:
Copygit checkout main
git pull origin main


This workflow helps prevent conflicts and keeps your repository organized. Your changes should now be reflected on GitHub Pages shortly
